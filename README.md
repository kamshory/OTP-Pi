OTP or `One Time Password` is a one-time use password that has a certain validity period. Generally the validity period is made very short and only gives the chance to the recipient to enter it into the application and send it to the application server that requires it. OTP is strictly confidential so the `clear text` of the OTP should not be stored by any party. In fact, the application server only stores the `hash` or `token` that matches the OTP. `Clear text` is only generated and then sent to the recipient. In other words, `clear text` is only known to the OTP recipient.

The most popular OTPs are sent via SMS or Short Message Service. The use of SMS has the following advantages:

1. Can only be received by the device where the SIM card is installed. This of course comply `What you have` role in `multifactor authentication`
2. Easily readable on almost all makes and models of mobile phone devices
3. Generally the device immediately notifies the presence of an incoming message without requiring user action
4. On smartphone devices, applications can directly read the message if permitted by the user. Thus, the application can directly verify the OTP without requiring manual action from the user. This will save time and reduce errors
5. Does not require the recipient's credit so that the recipient of the message does not have to pay anything to be able to receive the message
6. Has a very wide range
7. SMS receiving devices are available in various price classes so that they can be reached by almost all people

Of the many advantages above, it turns out that SMS has limitations. SMS must be sent through a telecommunications operator legally registered in the sending country. SMS can be sent using a GSM device connected to a telecommunications operator. The cheapest devices for sending SMS are cell phones and modems. In addition, the sender must pay a service fee to the telecommunications operator. This fee will be shared to all operators involved in sending SMS.

Another way to send SMS is by working directly with telecommunications operators or using third party services. Cooperation with telecommunications operators is certainly not easy. In addition to having a legal entity, the costs required are of course not small. In addition, the volume of SMS sending is also a consideration for whether the cooperation is accepted or not by the telecommunications operator. The use of third party services is another option. The safety factor is of course a consideration. The service provider must of course be trusted to maintain the confidentiality of the OTP sent.

For small-scale companies who want to build their own OTP delivery system, they can use a variety of applications that are available for free or paid in the market. Some considerations in choosing an OTP application are as follows:

1. Delivery speed
2. Security/confidentiality
3. Ease of installation and integration
4. Initial costs and operational costs

Applications that use a database to connect between the receiving side of the message and the GSM modem are of course not secure. The data in the database can be read by the administrator. In fact, administrators can request OTP when the user is not aware of it and is not transacting.

Applications that require the use of a public IP address of course do not provide flexibility for users. Companies or individuals who do not subscribe to the internet with a public IP cannot use the application. Users need to place the server on a network with a public IP.

Applications that run on desktops and laptops of course require high investment and operational costs. The laptop or desktop that is used must operate 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. Of course, the electricity used is not small.

OTP-Pi answers all of the above challenges. With a very cheap device, users can have an SMS gateway that provides many features and can be operated at a very low cost.

OTP-Pi is a server for sending SMS via HTTP, WebSocket and Message Broker protocols. Users can install OTP-Pi on the server with a static IP address that can be accessed by clients who will send SMS. In addition, users can also install OTP-Pi on servers with dynamic IP addresses. This server then accesses a websocket server, RabbitMQ server or Mosquitto server. OTP-Pi acts as a consumer that will send all SMS it receives.

To publish message using PHP to RabbitMQ, Mosquitto and Redis, see example on https://github.com/kamshory/OTP-Publisher 

# System Requirement

OTP-Pi requires Raspberry Pi 3 Model B or higher. Minimum RAM is 1 GB and SD Card minimum is 16 GB. 32GB SD Card is recommended. Power supply 5 Volt 3 Ampre to prevent the Raspberry Pi from operating with under voltage. RTC DS3231 installed on Raspberry Pi.

# Features

## Multiple Method

User can send OTP with several methods. OTP-Pi allow user to create and validate OTP via REST API or just send SMS or email contains OTP code via RabbitMQ,Redis, Mosquitto and WebSocket.

![Support](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kamshory/OTP-Pi/main/support.png)

| Method | Send SMS | Send Email | Block MSISDN | Unblock MSISDN | Create OTP | Validate OTP |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| REST API | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| RabbitMQ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Redis | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Mosquitto | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| WebSocket | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |

## Multiple Device

Modem is a list of modems installed on the OTP-Pi. Modems are named based on the make and model of the device and the connection used. The modem can be turned on and off at any time. An inactive modem will not be used to send SMS even if it is physically attached to the OTP-Pi and receiving power.

![Prefix-Based Routing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kamshory/OTP-Pi/main/prefix-based-routing.png)

![OTP-Pi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kamshory/OTP-Pi/main/usb-hub-20-port.png)

OTP-Pi can use multiple modems at once. By default, the OTP-Pi can use up to 4 modems at once without the need for additional devices. The use of a hub is possible so that users can use more than 4 modems in one OTP-Pi device. The modems are registered as usual. Sending SMS will use the Round-Robin algorithm where all active modems will be used in rotation.

## Prefix-Based Routing

In reality, cost efficiency becomes very important for users. The cost of sending SMS should be reduced as much as possible. Telecommunications operators usually apply lower cost when sending SMS to subscriber numbers of the same telecommunications operator. On the other hand, the cost of sending SMS will be higher when sending SMS to customer numbers from other operators.

OTP-Pi allows users to set up SMS sending. For example: a user uses 4 modems with 4 different SIM cards from different telecommunication operators.

1. Modem 1 with SIM Card from Telecommunications Operator 1
2. Modem 2 with SIM Card from Telecommunications Operator 2
3. Modem 3 with SIM Card from Telecommunications Operator 3
4. Modem 4 with SIM Card from Telecommunications Operator 4

Telecommunications Operator 1 applies a fee of IDR 50 for numbers with prefixes `62871` and `62872` and applies a fee of IDR 350 for numbers other than that.
Telecommunications Operator 2 applies a fee of IDR 100 for numbers with prefixes `62835`, `62856`, and `62837` and applies a fee of IDR 350 for numbers other than that.
Telecommunications Operator 3 applies a fee of IDR 60 for numbers with the prefix `62845` and applies a fee of IDR 250 for numbers other than that.
Telecommunications Operator 4 applies a fee of IDR 90 for numbers with prefixes `62848` and `62849` and applies a fee of IDR 200 for numbers other than that.

From the case above, the lowest cost for other operators is IDR 200. Users can set modem 4 as the default modem. All SMS other than the prefixes `62871`, `62872`, `62835`, `62856`, `62837` and `62845` will use this modem and are sent via Telecommunications Operator 4. All SMS for numbers with prefixes `62871` and ` 62872` uses modem 1 and is sent via Telecommunication Operator 1. All SMS for numbers with prefix `62835`, `62856`, and `62837` use modem 2 and are sent via Telecommunication Operator 2. All SMS for numbers with prefix `62845` use modem 3 and sent via Telecommunication Operator 3. Thus, the cost of sending SMS will be reduced.

![Prefix-Based Routing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kamshory/OTP-Pi/main/full-diagram.png)

Users can use 2 or more SIM cards from the same operator. The modem will be used interchangeably with the Round-Robin algorithm when OTP-Pi sends SMS to numbers with the same prefix.

The cost of sending SMS will be even lower when the user takes advantage of the promo from the telecommunications operator in question. Some operators will apply very low SMS sending fees after the user sends several SMS with certain conditions.

Prefix setting using MSISDN. Thus, in the example above, when a user in Indonesia sets the prefix 0871, it stores 62871. Thus, the user must use the prefix length of 5 instead of 4.

## USSD Support

OTP-Pi allows users to perform USSD commands on individual modems. The USSD command, of course, depends on each telecomunications operator used on each SIM card installed on each modem.

## Manual SMS

Manual SMS is used to test whether each modem can send SMS.

## Internet Mobile

The OTP-Pi can connect to the internet using a mobile modem. Thus, users do not need to connect the OTP-Pi with wired or optical internet. It provides an alternative for users in choosing an internet connection.

## Administrator Settings

Administrator Settings is a menu to configure administrator. New OTP-Pi devices don't have an administrator yet. The user must create an administrator first before using it. Please enter the OTP-Pi access point according to the SSID and password listed on the brochure and scan the QR Code on the brochure using a smartphone.

## Multiple Email Account

OTP-Pi supports multiple email accounts. Email account is a configuration that contains SMTP Server address, SMTP server port, username, password, and other configurations.

SMTP Server is used to send OTP to email addresses and can be used to reset passwords.

The use of multiple email accounts is recommended because the number of emails sent by each email account will decrease. For example: an SMTP server limits 500 emails per day. Using 20 email accounts, OTP-Pi can send up to 10,000 emails per day.

To use Gmail SMTP, use the following configuration:

**Use Port 587**

| Field | Value |
| --- | ------ |
| SMTP Host | smtp.gmail.com |
| SMTP Port | 587 |
| SSL Enable | No |
| Start TLS Before Send | Yes |

The configuration above will create file `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf` with its content as follows:

```
option domain-name "otppi.lan";
option domain-name-servers ns1.otppi.lan, ns2.otppi.lan;
default-lease-time 3600; 
max-lease-time 7200;
authoritative;

subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {

        option subnet-mask              255.255.255.0;
        option domain-search            "otppi.lan";
        option domain-name-servers      192.168.0.11;
        range   192.168.0.10   192.168.0.100;
        range   192.168.0.110   192.168.0.200;
}
```

### Wireless LAN

## Firewalls

OTP-Pi can open and close ports of the operating system used by SMS Broker. Closing this port will create a firewall at the operating system layer. In this case, if the port is closed, the equest will not reach the application.

## Monitor

The monitor can be used to view the activity of the modem installed on the OTP-Pi. When the OTP-Pi sends an SMS, the OTP-Pi will show where the SMS request came from and which modem was used. In addition, the status of the modem will be shown so that it will be seen which modems are connected correctly.

## SMS Inbox

OTP-Pi provides a feature to read incoming SMS. The OTP-Pi will read all the SMS on the SIM card and move them to the storage on the device.

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kamshory/OTP-Pi/main/feature-inbox.png)

Users can delete the SMS when it is no longer needed. Users can also reply to the SMS manually from the OTP-Pi.

## IMEI Tool

OTP-Pi provides a tool to change the IMEI of the modem. This tool is very useful for users who want to change IMEI for some reason. Users can directly enter the new IMEI and save it. The new IMEI will be written on the modem chip. Restarting the device may be required to implement the new IMEI on the GSM network.

## SIM Tool

OTP-Pi provides tools to create or delete sim card PIN. This tool is very useful when the user chooses to use or not to use the PIN on the sim card.

## Real Time Clock

The Real Time Clock or RTC module is required to keep the device time when the device is turned off and not connected to the internet. The device must use the correct time so that the cookies sent by the device are not deleted by the browser due to expiration so that the administrator can manage the device including making settings. In addition, the device needs to record the time when an error occurred so that the error log can be read by the user for mitigation.

![OTP-Pi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kamshory/OTP-Pi/main/ds3231.png)

The Real Time Clock module is built into the device and is programmed to work as intended. If the device is off for a long time causing the RTC battery to run out, the device can adjust the time according to the browser that accesses it regardless of the time zone used. Furthermore, the administrator can set the device time if needed.

## Reset Device

In case the user cannot access the administration web, either because he forgot his password, or because the network configuration is messed up, the user can reset the device. Reset the device is done by plugging in a flash disk containing the following file:

`/otppi/reset-config.ini`

Directory name, file name and extension must be written correctly in lower case. The `/otppi/reset-config.ini` file should contain the following text:

```ini
VERIFY = eyJkZXZpY2VUeXBlIjoiUlBpIiwgImJhc2VOYW1lIjoicmVzZXQtY29uZmlnLmluaSJ9

# Topology

Both WebSocket and Message Broker use a topic that can be configured from both sides (sender and receiver).

To use WebSocket, please use the WSMessageBrocker library with the link https://github.com/kamshory/Messenger or you can create your own.

To use RabbitMQ, please open the link https://www.rabbitmq.com/

To use Redis, please open the link https://redis.io/

To use Mosquitto, please open the link https://mosquitto.org/


![OTP-Pi Topology](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kamshory/OTP-Pi/main/resource/www/lib.assets/images/topology.svg)

### Scenario 1 - App Server Can Access OTP-Pi 

In this scenario, the App Server can directly send the OTP to the OTP-Pi via HTTP.

![OTP-Pi Topology Scenario 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kamshory/OTP-Pi/main/resource/www/lib.assets/images/topology-1.svg)

Users can use a cheap domain and use the Dynamic Domain Name System for free. With the use of port forwarding on the router, OTP-Pi can be accessed from anywhere using a domain or subdomain. In this scenario, the user needs:

1. OTP-Pi
2. Fixed internet connection with public IP (static or dynamic)
3. Router that can do port forwarding
4. Domains whose name servers can be set
5. Dynamic DNS service (free or paid)

In this scenario, the application server can generate and validate the OTP sent for each transaction. OTP creation and validation requires the following parameters:

**reference**

`reference` is unique transaction reference number. This number must be different from one transaction to another. This number is the key to validate the OTP.

**receiver**

`receiver` is the phone number or email address of the recipient.

**param1, param2, param3, param4**

These four parameters are additional information for validating the OTP. These four parameters must be the same between OTP creation and validation. Of course this parameter can be filled with empty strings. Information that can be used as this parameter is for example the sender's account number, the recipient's account number, the transaction amount (in string format), and so on.

OTP-Pi does not store the clear OTP but only stores the hash. In addition, the OTP-Pi immediately deletes the SMS sent immediately after. Thus, the OTP is very safe because it is only known by the recipient.

### Scenario 2 - App Server Can't Access OTP-Pi

In this scenario, the App Server may send the OTP to RabbitMQ Server, Redis Server, Mosquitto Server or WSMessageBroker. WSMessageBroker uses the WebSoket protocol and Basic Authentication. Both App Server and OTP-Pi act as clients of WSMessageBroker.

App Server acts as publisher and OTP-Pi becomes consumer of RabbitMQ Server, Redis Server, Mosquitto Server and WSMessageBroker. Both must use the same topic so that all OTPs sent by the App Server can be received by the OTP-Pi.

![OTP-Pi Topology Scenario 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kamshory/OTP-Pi/main/resource/www/lib.assets/images/topology-2.svg)

From the two scenarios above, the OTP-Pi will send SMS using a GSM modem that is physically attached to the OTP-Pi device. Users can use either RabbitMQ Server, Mosquitto Server or WSMessageBroker and can also use both at the same time. However, if the App Server sends the same OTP to RabbitMQ Server, Mosquitto Server and WSMessageBroker, the OTP-Pi will send the SMS twice to the recipient number.

In this scenario, the user does not need a public IP. Users only need:

1. OTP-Pi
2. Internet connection (no need for public IP and port forwarding)
3. RabbitMQ, Mosquitto or WSMessageBroker servers

The WSMessageBroker-based server uses the WebSocket protocol. Please download WSMessageBroker at https://github.com/kamshory/Messenger

**Handhakes**

The handshake between OTP-Pi and WSMessageBroker is as follows:
1. OTP-Pi as client and WSMessageBroker as server
2. OTP-Pi sends request to WSMessageBroker

**WebSocket Subscriber Configuration Example**

| Parameter | Value |
|--|--|
| Host | domain.example |
| Port | 8000 |
| Path | /ws |
| Username | username |
| Password | password |
| Topic | sms |

**Example of a WebSocket Handhake**

```http
GET /ws?topic=sms HTTP/1.1
Host: domain.example:8000
Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
```

The server will verify whether the username and password are correct. If true, the server will add the connection to the list of recipients of the message.

When a client sends a message, the message will be sent to all clients by topic except the sender. Thus, the handshake between the sender and the recipient of the message is the same.

The OTP-Pi never sends messages to the WSMessageBroker server. OTP-Pi only accepts messages according to the desired topic.
